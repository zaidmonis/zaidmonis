## About Me

I’m a **Software Engineer** currently working in **Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia**, with a strong focus on **backend development**, system design, and building APIs that are predictable, scalable, and secure.

Over the years, I’ve worked across different stacks and environments — from startups to large organizations — which has helped me develop a strong appreciation for **clean architecture**, **maintainable code**, and **pragmatic engineering decisions**.

I enjoy learning by building, breaking, fixing, and rebuilding systems — each iteration teaching me something new about design, performance, or trade-offs.

## Tech Stack & Experience

At this point, I’ve worked with and built production systems using:

| Programming Languages | Frameworks & Platforms | Web & App Tech              | Databases  | Cloud & DevOps | Design & UX        |
|----------------------|------------------------|-----------------------------|------------|---------------|--------------------|
| Java, Kotlin, C#     | Spring Boot, .NET Core | HTML, CSS, JavaScript       | MySQL      | Azure         | Figma              |
| Python               | Android, Firebase      | TypeScript, REST APIs       | MSSQL      | AWS           | Material Design    |
|                      |                        |                             | MongoDB   |               |                    |

## What Drives Me

### 🛠 Love to Make Things Work
There’s something deeply satisfying about seeing a system come alive — an API behaving exactly as intended, a workflow finally clicking into place, or a feature making life easier for real users. That moment makes all the effort worth it.

---

### 🚀 Passionate Developer
I value **consistency over intensity**. Learning every day, improving incrementally, and staying curious has taken me much further than chasing shortcuts ever could.

I’ve spent countless hours experimenting, refactoring, and rethinking solutions — not because I had to, but because I genuinely enjoy the process.

---

### 🧠 Problem Solver
From debugging production issues to designing new services from scratch, I enjoy breaking down problems, understanding constraints, and finding solutions that are **simple, effective, and sustainable**.

I don’t mind starting from zero if that’s what it takes to do things right.

---

### 🌍 Explorer by Nature
Switching between technologies has taught me an important lesson:

> Most systems share the same core ideas — only the tools and syntax change.

This mindset helps me stay flexible and focus on **fundamentals**, whether it’s backend architecture, distributed systems, or security considerations.

---

### 🏗 Aspiring System Designer
I actively push myself toward **end-to-end ownership** — thinking beyond just code and into scalability, performance, observability, and long-term maintenance.

Every project is an opportunity to design something a little better than before.

---

### ✨ Clean Code Enthusiast
Readable, well-structured code matters to me. I believe code should:
- Explain *what* it does without needing comments
- Be easy to change without fear
- Age well as systems grow

Clean code isn’t perfection — it’s respect for future developers (including future me).

---

### 🔁 Embracing Failures
Failure has been one of my best teachers.

I’ve had ideas rejected, designs reworked, and assumptions proven wrong. Each time, I learned something valuable — about technology, about people, and about myself.

> Progress comes from trying, failing, reflecting, and trying again.

## Finally

This profile is a snapshot of an ongoing journey — one focused on **learning**, **building meaningful systems**, and **growing as an engineer**.

Thanks to everyone who has challenged me, guided me, and pushed me outside my comfort zone.

Until next time ✌🏻
